I'm a PhD student at [UIUC](http://illinois.edu/) and an aspiring 
[data scientist](http://i.giphy.com/ize2r20ICQONq.gif). My interests are in data mining, 
analytics and visualization.

## data-slinky
<br>
I originally created data-slinky to highlight some projects I've done. Since all the cool 
kids have blogs these days, I figured why not. data-slinky is a data science portfolio plus 
a collection of tutorials and thoughts. All datasets and code are either uploaded to
[Github](https://github.com/data-slinky) or available publicly unless it's work-related or
research in-progress (hey, I gotta eat too).

This website was built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) with the
[folio](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) theme plus some personalize tweaks. Of course, 
everything is made with &#9829; + &#9749;.
