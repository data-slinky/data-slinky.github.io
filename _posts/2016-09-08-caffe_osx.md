[Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) is an open-source deep learning framework created 
at Berkeley that makes it easier to code learning algorithms more easily and efficiently. 
I'm working with some computer vision models so it's pretty awesome. It was also a pain 
in the ass to install correctly due to it's huge number of dependencies and configurations.

While the installation instructions on the [website](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/install_osx.html)
was very detailed, I still ran into some errors (probably because I tend to skim instructions). It took
many Google-searches to finally get it up and running so I decided to take some notes for the future.
Before we begin, some notes:

* I did this installation for OS X El Capitan.
* Caffe is designed to work great with Python 2. It can work with Python 3 but good luck with 
that. I assume you have Python installed (make life easier to just install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)). 

# Step 1: Download and install CUDA

You will need to register to download the [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).
You might also want to update the driver for Mac with the latest from [here](http://www.nvidia.com/object/mac-driver-archive.html).

After installing CUDA, set the environment:

```shell
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

# Step 1.5: (Optional) Download and install cuDNN

You can download and install [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) to speed up computations. 
Remember to set the environmental path to the installation with

```shell
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH='/path/here/lib':$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

# Step 2: Install homebrew

If you haven't install homebrew already, do:

```shell
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

# Step 3: Install Caffe and Python dependencies

```shell
brew install wget
brew install lmdb
brew install leveldb
brew install protobuf
brew install boost-python
brew install snappy
brew install gflags
brew install glog
brew tap homebrew/science
brew install opencv
brew install hdf5
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install scikit-image
pip install h5py
pip install Cython
pip install protobuf
pip install lmdb
pip install leveldb
pip install python-gflags
```

# Step 4: Get caffe

The repo is [here](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe). Once cloned, navigate to the 
directory and do the following.

# Step 5: Change the Makefile

Get the Makefile configuration.

```shell
cp Makefile.config.example Makefile.config
```

Now, you need to edit your Makefile. If you installed cuDNN then you need to uncomment the 
```USE_CUDNN := 1``` and add it to ```INCLUDE_DIRS```. Check the ```PYTHON_INCLUDE``` to 
make sure your Python 2 path is correct.	

# Step 6: Build Caffe

Run the following:

```shell
make all
make pycaffe
```

This step might take a while. After it finish, tell Python where to find Caffe:

```shell
export PYTHONPATH=~/dir/to/caffe/python:$PYTHONPATH
```

# Step 7: Test it

Try importing Caffe with:

```shell
python2 -c "import caffe"
```

If you see an error, happy Googling!
