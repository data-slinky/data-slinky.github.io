# Motivation

Being at a university, you always hear about which schools are crawling up the ladder and 
which are dropping off. Lets avoid discussions on the subjectivity and inherent bias of 
college rankings and focus on the data. Ranking methodologies are usually not disclosed so 
I'm curious if we can use the data to determine how these organizations are rating. I 
pursued this project to further develop my machine learning abilities and to also satisfy 
my interests in data visualizations.

# Data + Code

The data is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/world-university-rankings). 
It includes world college rankings from three organizations in addition to educational 
attainment and expenditures for countries. You can gather more details from the link.

All code for the project is in this [repository(https://github.com/jknguye2/college_rankings).
