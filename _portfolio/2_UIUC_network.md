# Motivation

I got the idea for this project when a friend was looking for a thesis advisor. Since he 
was in ECE, he had to find an advisor within the department or a faculty affiliated. There 
isn't a great way to find who is affiliated with who besides going through the department
website and looking at people's bio so I thought making a network visualization would be 
useful and fun thing to do.
